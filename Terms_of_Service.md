## 1. Acceptance of Terms

By accessing or using the DRR platform — including creating an account, logging in, or interacting with any part of the service — you agree to be bound by these Terms of Service ("Terms") and all associated policies (Privacy Policy, Cookie Policy, Acceptable Use Policy, Security Policy).

If you do not agree to these Terms, you must not use DRR. If you are using DRR on behalf of an organisation, you represent that you have authority to bind that organisation to these Terms.

## 2. The Service

DRR is a domain and SSL certificate expiry monitoring platform. It allows users to:
- Track domain name expiration dates via WHOIS lookups.
- Track SSL certificate validity periods via TLS handshake inspection.
- Receive expiry alerts through connected third-party platforms (Slack, Discord, Microsoft Teams, Telegram).
- Manage monitoring resources within a company-scoped workspace.

### 2.1 No Guarantee of Accuracy
WHOIS data is supplied by external registries and registrars and may be delayed, incomplete, or inaccurate. SSL certificate information is retrieved at the time of the check and reflects the state of the certificate at that moment. DRR does not guarantee that the information displayed is real-time or free from error.

### 2.2 Third-Party Dependencies
The notification delivery feature depends on the continuous availability of third-party APIs (Slack, Discord, Microsoft Teams, Telegram). DRR has no control over those services and cannot guarantee their uptime or reliability.

## 3. Accounts

### 3.1 Account Creation
You must create an account and verify your email address to use DRR. You must be at least 16 years old. You are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of your account credentials and for all actions taken under your account.

### 3.2 Accuracy of Information
You agree to provide accurate, complete, and current information during registration and to keep it up to date. Providing false or misleading information may result in account suspension or termination.

### 3.3 Company Scope
Each account is associated with a company. All data entered under that company is visible only to verified users of the same company. You must not attempt to access data belonging to another company.

---

## 4. Use of the Service

You agree to use DRR only in accordance with these Terms, the Acceptable Use Policy, and all applicable laws and regulations. You are solely responsible for ensuring that your use of DRR complies with the laws of your jurisdiction.

---

## 5. Intellectual Property

All content, software, and materials provided by DRR — including but not limited to logos, text, graphics, and code — are the intellectual property of [Your Company Legal Name] or its licensors and are protected by applicable intellectual property laws. You are granted a limited, non-exclusive, non-transferable, revocable licence to use DRR solely for your own internal business purposes.

You must not:
- Copy, modify, reverse-engineer, or decompile any part of DRR.
- Remove or alter any proprietary notices or labels.
- Use DRR's intellectual property outside the scope of this licence.

---

## 6. Third-Party Integrations

When you connect a third-party service (Slack, Discord, Microsoft Teams, or Telegram), you authorise DRR to interact with that service on your behalf using the credentials you provide. You acknowledge that:

- Each third-party service has its own Terms of Service and Privacy Policy, which you are independently responsible for reading and complying with.
- DRR is not affiliated with, endorsed by, or a partner of any third-party integration provider.
- The availability and behaviour of third-party integrations are outside DRR's control.
- Disconnecting an integration at any time will revoke DRR's ability to send notifications through that platform.

## 7. Limitation of Liability

**TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, [YOUR COMPANY LEGAL NAME] AND ITS DIRECTORS, OFFICERS, EMPLOYEES, AGENTS, AFFILIATES, AND SERVICE PROVIDERS SHALL NOT BE LIABLE FOR ANY INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO:**

## 8. Disclaimer of Warranties

**DRR IS PROVIDED ON AN "AS IS" AND "AS AVAILABLE" BASIS WITHOUT WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, TITLE, AND NON-INFRINGEMENT.**

**[YOUR COMPANY LEGAL NAME] DOES NOT WARRANT THAT:**

- **ANY DEFECTS OR ERRORS WILL BE CORRECTED;**

## 9. Indemnification

You agree to indemnify, defend, and hold harmless [Your Company Legal Name] and its directors, officers, employees, agents, affiliates, and service providers from and against any claims, liabilities, damages, losses, costs, and expenses (including reasonable legal fees) arising out of or related to:

- Your use of DRR in violation of these Terms or any applicable law;

### 10.2 By DRR
[Your Company Legal Name] reserves the right to suspend or terminate your account, with or without notice, if you violate these Terms, the Acceptable Use Policy, or any applicable law. In cases of material violation, termination may be immediate.

### 10.3 Effect of Termination
Upon termination, your right to use DRR ceases immediately. Provisions that by their nature survive termination — including Sections 5 (Intellectual Property), 7 (Limitation of Liability), 8 (Disclaimer of Warranties), 9 (Indemnification), and 12 (Governing Law) — shall survive.

---

## 11. Changes to These Terms

[Your Company Legal Name] may update these Terms from time to time. Material changes will be communicated via email or a prominent notice within the DRR application at least 14 days before they take effect. Your continued use of DRR after the effective date constitutes acceptance of the updated Terms.

---

## 12. Governing Law and Dispute Resolution

These Terms shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the jurisdiction in which [Your Company Legal Name] is incorporated, without regard to its conflict-of-law principles.

Any dispute arising out of or related to these Terms that cannot be resolved through negotiation shall be submitted to the courts of that jurisdiction. Nothing in this section prevents either party from seeking injunctive relief in any court of competent jurisdiction to prevent irreparable harm.

> **EU/UK users:** This clause does not prevent you from bringing a claim before the courts of your home jurisdiction or from exercising statutory consumer rights available under EU or UK law.

---

## 13. Entire Agreement

These Terms, together with the Privacy Policy, Cookie Policy, Acceptable Use Policy, and Security Policy, constitute the entire agreement between you and [Your Company Legal Name] regarding DRR and supersede all prior agreements, understandings, or arrangements on the same subject.

---

## 14. Severability

If any provision of these Terms is found to be unenforceable or invalid under applicable law, that provision will be modified to the minimum extent necessary to make it enforceable, and the remaining provisions will continue in full force and effect.
